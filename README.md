# MotionApi Public API — Developer Guide

Developer-facing guide for the **MotionApi `/v1` public API**. It tells you how to issue an API key, what endpoints exist, how to receive real-time data, and how to run the two reference examples we ship.

> The auto-generated OpenAPI reference at <https://api.motionapi.pro/v1/docs> is the source of truth for request and response shapes. This guide explains the **how** and the **why** around it.

## What you can do with the API

MotionApi sells GPS+LTE-M tracker hardware. The `/v1` API lets you build on top of those trackers without touching MQTT directly:

- **List your devices** and their last-known position / battery / signal.
- **Read snapshots** — the most recent packet on every topic per device (`gps`, `status`, `event`, `imu`, `bin`).
- **Subscribe to live data** over WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.
- **Send commands** (identify, buzzer, LED, reboot, MARK).
- **Change the device mode preset** (14 presets — standard 1–6, logging 20–28).

All real-time data flows through the backend; you never need MQTT credentials.

**Base URL:** `https://api.motionapi.pro`

## Getting an API key

1. Sign in to the **user panel** at <https://app.motionapi.pro>.
2. From the left nav choose **API Access**. *(screenshot needed — see [§ screenshots](#where-to-put-screenshots))*
3. Click **Create Key** in the top-right.
4. In the modal: *(screenshot needed)*
   - **Name** — anything that helps you remember which integration uses it.
   - **Environment** — `live` (production) or `test`.
   - **Scopes** — pick only what you need. Defaults to `read:devices`, `read:stream`, `read:last`.
   - **Devices** — leave empty for "all my devices" or pick a subset.
   - **Rate limit** — leave empty to use the default 60 req/min; raise it if you have an approved use case.
   - **Expires at** — optional ISO date for an auto-expiring key.
5. Click **Create**. The full key is shown **once** — copy it now. *(screenshot needed)* After you close the modal the secret is gone (only the prefix is retrievable later). If you lose it, **rotate the key**.

A key looks like:

```
mak_live_abcd1234_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
└┬┘ └┬─┘ └───┬───┘ └─────────────┬─────────────┘
 │   │       │                   └── 32-char secret (kept server-side as sha256)
 │   │       └── 8-char prefix tail — used for listings + audit log
 │   └── environment: `live` or `test`
 └── product prefix: "MotionApi Key"
```

The **prefix** (`mak_live_abcd1234`) is safe to log. The full key is not. Treat it like a password.

---

## Authentication

Send the full key as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header on every request:

```http
GET /v1/devices HTTP/1.1
Host: api.motionapi.pro
Authorization: Bearer mak_live_abcd1234_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

For browser-native **WebSocket** and **Server-Sent Events** (where custom headers aren't allowed) pass the key in the `?token=` query string instead:

```
wss://api.motionapi.pro/v1/stream?token=mak_live_abcd1234_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

Authorization header always wins if both are set.

---

## Scopes

Each API key carries a list of scopes. Endpoints require specific scopes; if a scope is missing you get **403 Forbidden**.

| Scope             | Grants                                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `read:devices`    | List devices, read metadata, read current mode                          |
| `read:last`       | Read the latest cached packet (`/last`, `/last/:topic`)                 |
| `read:stream`     | Subscribe to WebSocket / SSE real-time streams                          |
| `read:positions`  | Historical GPS query                                                    |
| `read:status`     | Historical device-status query                                          |
| `read:events`     | Historical events query                                                 |
| `read:imu`        | Raw IMU data                                                            |
| `write:commands`  | Send commands (buzzer, LED, identify, reboot, MARK)                     |
| `write:mode`      | Change device mode preset                                               |
| `write:ota`       | Upload firmware (off by default — contact us to enable)                 |

Principle of least privilege — for a dashboard that just shows positions you only need `read:devices` + `read:last` + `read:stream`.

---

## Endpoints — REST

All endpoints below sit under `https://api.motionapi.pro/v1` and return the same envelope:

```json
{ "success": true,  "data": ..., "meta": { ... } }
{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "rate_limited", "message": "...", "details": {} } }
```

### Devices

| Method | Path                                         | Scope          | Description                                          |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/v1/devices`                                | `read:devices` | List devices your key can access                     |
| GET    | `/v1/devices/:iccid`                         | `read:devices` | Single device with cached status + current mode      |
| GET    | `/v1/devices/:iccid/mode`                    | `read:devices` | Full current mode preset (timings, IMU flag, …)      |
| PUT    | `/v1/devices/:iccid/mode`                    | `write:mode`   | Switch the device to a different mode preset         |
| GET    | `/v1/devices/_modes`                         | (none)         | Static catalog of all 14 mode presets                |

### Snapshots — last cached packet per topic

| Method | Path                                         | Scope       | Description                                                       |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/v1/devices/:iccid/last`                    | `read:last` | Latest packet on every topic the device has spoken                |
| GET    | `/v1/devices/:iccid/last/:topic`             | `read:last` | Latest packet on one specific topic (`gps`, `status`, `bin`, …)   |

Add `?format=raw` to get the bytes the device actually sent (base64 + frame metadata), or `?format=formatted` for human-readable JSON (default).

### Commands

| Method | Path                                         | Scope             | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/v1/devices/:iccid/commands`                | `write:commands`  | Send `identify` / `buzzer` / `led` / `status` / `reboot` |

Body example:

```json
{ "cmd": "buzzer", "params": { "duration_ms": 500, "frequency": 4000 } }
```

Mode changes are **not** accepted here — use `PUT /v1/devices/:iccid/mode` instead.

### Curl quick-start

```bash
# Replace the bearer token with your real key.
KEY="mak_live_abcd1234_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"

# List devices
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" https://api.motionapi.pro/v1/devices

# Latest GPS snapshot for one device
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  'https://api.motionapi.pro/v1/devices/8988228066680471572/last/gps?format=formatted'

# Buzz for 500 ms
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cmd":"buzzer","params":{"duration_ms":500}}' \
  https://api.motionapi.pro/v1/devices/8988228066680471572/commands
```

## Streaming — WebSocket & SSE

Real-time data has two transports. Pick what's easier to consume:

### WebSocket — `wss://api.motionapi.pro/v1/stream`

Scope: `read:stream`. Bidirectional — you tell it which devices and topics you care about.

Flow:

1. **Connect** with the API key in `?token=`.
2. Server sends a `{"type":"ready", "authorized_devices":[…]}` frame so you know what you may subscribe to.
3. You send a subscribe message:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "subscribe",
     "devices": ["8988228066680471572"],
     "topics": ["gps", "status", "event", "bin"],
     "format": "formatted"
   }
   ```
4. Server responds with `{"type":"subscribed", "devices_authorized":[…], "devices_denied":[…], "topics":[…], "format":"…"}`.
5. Server pushes `{"type":"packet", "iccid":"…", "topic":"gps", "received_at":"…", "seq":…, "payload":{…}}` per packet, plus periodic `{"type":"heartbeat"}` frames.

If you send `"format":"raw"` packets include `raw.buffer_b64` + `raw.frames[]` (for binary topics like `bin`) instead of `payload`.

You may re-send `subscribe` at any time to change filter or format — the server will replace the previous subscription on the same socket.

### Server-Sent Events — `GET /v1/devices/:iccid/stream`

Scope: `read:stream`. One-way (server → you), one device per connection. Works through stricter corporate proxies that block WS.

```bash
curl -N "https://api.motionapi.pro/v1/devices/8988228066680471572/stream?topics=gps,status&format=formatted" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Each event is a standard `data: { …packet… }\n\n` SSE chunk. Use the `format=raw` querystring for raw bytes; `topics=…` is a CSV filter.

### Close codes (WebSocket only)

| Code | Meaning                                              |
|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1000 | Normal close                                         |
| 4001 | Unauthorized — bad / missing / revoked API key       |
| 4003 | Forbidden — key missing `read:stream` scope          |

---

## Packet formats — `raw` vs `formatted`

Every read endpoint and stream subscription accepts a `format`:

- **`formatted`** *(default)* — JSON, SI units (m/s, meters, degrees), with mode preset expanded inline. Easiest to consume.
- **`raw`** — exact bytes received from the device. Binary frames (`bin` topic, currently the production path for GPS) come as base64 plus per-frame metadata so you can decode them yourself. Choose this if you want to write your own decoder, archive bytes 1:1, or debug.

The wire-level frame format for binary topics (sync `0x4D 0x41`, 8-bit type, LE16 length, payload, Fletcher-8 checksum) is documented inline in the platform's `packages/shared/constants/protocol.ts` (private repo — ask if you need access).

---

## Rate limits & error envelope

- **Default:** 60 requests/min per key. Per-key custom limit available on request.
- **WebSocket / SSE:** the initial handshake counts; subsequent frames don't.
- **Limit hit:** HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header **and** body:
  ```json
  { "success": false,
    "error": { "code": "rate_limited",
               "message": "Rate limit exceeded (60 req/min)",
               "details": { "retry_after_ms": 12345 } } }
  ```

Other common error codes:

| Code              | HTTP | Meaning                                            |
|-------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `unauthorized`    | 401  | Missing / bad / revoked / expired key              |
| `forbidden`       | 403  | Authenticated but key missing required scope       |
| `not_found`       | 404  | No such device, topic, or endpoint                 |
| `invalid_request` | 400  | Body / query failed schema validation              |
| `rate_limited`    | 429  | Per-key rate limit hit                             |

Every error response has `success: false` and an `error.code` you can switch on. The human `error.message` is for logs — don't parse it.

## Reference examples

We ship two open examples — pick whichever matches your stack.

### Example 1 — Browser API Explorer

A single-file HTML demo of every `/v1` surface (snapshots, streams, commands, mode switching). Zero build, no dependencies — open the file and go.

- **Repo:** <https://github.com/MotionApi/example-api-explorer>
- **Live:** <https://motionapi.github.io/example-api-explorer/>
- **What's inside:** one `index.html`, ~38 KB, vanilla JS — copy-paste-ready.

**How to use:**

1. Open the live URL or clone the repo and `open index.html`.
2. Paste your API key into the header field. *(screenshot needed — see [§ screenshots](#where-to-put-screenshots))*
3. Pick a device from the left sidebar.
4. Use the tabs:
   - **Snapshot** — latest packet on every topic, toggle `formatted` ↔ `raw`.
   - **Live Stream** — `wss://…/v1/stream` with per-topic filter and format selector. *(screenshot needed — the running live-stream view is the best advert for the API)*
   - **Commands** — quick buttons that hit `POST /v1/devices/:iccid/commands`.
   - **Mode** — read + change the mode preset (`PUT /v1/devices/:iccid/mode`).

Required scopes follow the table in [§ Endpoints](#endpoints--rest). The explorer surfaces backend 401/403 errors inline so you know exactly which scope you forgot.

**When to use:** as a sanity check after issuing a key, to demo the system, or as a starting point for a custom dashboard (fork the HTML, strip what you don't need).

### Example 2 — Python position logger

A small Python script that subscribes to one tracker and writes every position to a CSV file. Useful for field testing, drive runs, and offline analysis.

- **Location:** `MotionApi-Platform/tools/python/log_positions.py` *(private repo — ask if you need access)*
- **Dependencies:** `paho-mqtt`, `python-dotenv` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

**Important — different transport:** This script talks to the MQTT broker directly (`mqtts://msg.f12lab.net:8883`) rather than going through the `/v1` API. It needs **MQTT broker credentials**, not an API key. We use it for internal field testing; if you want to do the same thing as an external integrator, please ask us — for most cases the WebSocket / SSE route from Example 1 is the right answer (no broker credentials needed, works the same).

**How it works:**

```
device  →  MQTT broker  →  log_positions.py  →  positions_<iccid>_<timestamp>.csv
                                ↑
                          paho-mqtt over TLS
                                ↑
                          credentials from .env
```

- Subscribes to `t/{ICCID}/bin` (binary, used by logging modes 20–28) **and** `t/{ICCID}/gps` (JSON, used by standard modes 1–6).
- Parses the binary frame format (sync `0x4D 0x41`, Fletcher-8 checksum, 24-byte GPS records) inline — see the top of `log_positions.py` for the decode loop.
- Writes one CSV row per position with both the device-side GPS timestamp and the host arrival timestamp (UTC).
- Flushes after every row so the file survives a `Ctrl+C`.

**Run:**

```bash
cd MotionApi-Platform/tools/python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python log_positions.py --iccid 8988228066680471572 --env ../../apps/backend/.env
```

The script also serves as a reference implementation of the binary frame decoder if you want to consume `format=raw` packets from the `/v1` stream and parse them yourself.

## Where to put screenshots

For the rendered version of this guide we want a handful of UI screenshots. Save PNGs into `screenshots/` and reference them inline as `![alt](screenshots/<filename>.png)`. Suggested shots (16:9 or whatever native resolution is, dark theme):

| Filename                         | What to capture                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api-access-page.png`            | User panel → API Access. Empty state if possible, so devs see "Create Key" affordance.                                                         |
| `create-key-modal.png`           | The Create Key modal with the scope checkboxes visible.                                                                                        |
| `key-created-reveal.png`         | The post-creation view that shows the full key once + the "save it now, you won't see it again" warning.                                       |
| `explorer-connect.png`           | The Explorer header with API + KEY fields filled, status dot green, **before** the device list loads (clean state).                            |
| `explorer-snapshot-tab.png`      | Snapshot tab showing one device's latest packets across topics — good for "this is what an integrator sees on day one".                       |
| `explorer-live-stream.png`       | Live Stream tab actively streaming packets — best single advert for the API.                                                                   |
| `explorer-commands-tab.png`      | Commands tab right after firing `buzzer` or `identify`, with the response panel visible.                                                       |
| `explorer-mode-tab.png`          | Mode tab with the preset dropdown open showing the 14 modes.                                                                                   |

When you've got them, drop them into `screenshots/` and update the doc — *(screenshot needed)* markers in the text above mark the spots.
